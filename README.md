## Summary
I am modelling an online takeout system. It gives the user a choice between two restaurants. They are then able to choose the different menu sections (E.g appetizers, desserts), and then individual items are listed. This loops up to 10 times or when they exit out the loop. The "receipt" then prints, listing the price of everything they typed, and the item they typed. It will then calculate the subtotal, taxes, and the tip if the user wishes to pay tips, and then output the total.
